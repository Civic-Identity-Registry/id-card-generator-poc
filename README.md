# Civic Identity Registry

## Overview

This project is part of the Civic Identity Registry system, designed to generate CIR ID cards for users.

## Information on the ID Card

- Name
- Date of Birth
- ID Number
- Photo
- Public Key
- Private Key

## Current Status

This is a testing and proof of concept implementation. The script currently operates standalone and does not interact with the CIR database server.

## Templates

The project uses HTML templates (`.html` files) as the base for ID card generation. These templates are customizable to accommodate different design requirements.

## Notice

The private key displayed in the output front of the ID card is a demo randomly generated string and is not the real private key generated from the key pair. This is because it is too long to be displayed in the front of the ID card; this will be replaced with real information in the future.
